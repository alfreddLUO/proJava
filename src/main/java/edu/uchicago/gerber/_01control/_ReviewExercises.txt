R1.5 The following are all benefits to using Java over machine code:
1/ Java bytecode is platform independent and may be run on any system that has a JVM. This quality is known as portability.
2/ Java JIT compilers can run efficient Java programs as fast or faster than machine code programs
3/ Java is memory-managed. This reduces about 95% of runtime errors (mostly memory-related) as compared to unmanaged code.
4/ Java was designed for networking and the Internet in mind; and it is generally safer than machine code
5/ With the introduction of Java8, Java is now a declarative and functional programming language.
6/ The GraalVM is capable of compiling Java programs to o/s targeted binary code, forgoing the JVM altogether.

R2.4 Translating math expressions to Java.
a. double s;
   double v;
   double t;
   double g;
   s = s + (v * t) + (0.5 * g * t * t);

b. double FV;
   double PV;
   double INT;
   int YRS;
   FV = PV * Math.pow((1 + INT), YRS);

c. double G;
   double p;
   double m1;
   double m2;
   double a;
   G= 4*(Math.PI*Math.PI)*Math.pow(a,3)/(Math.pow(p,2)*(m1+m2));

d. double c;
   double a;
   double b;
   double gamma;
   c=Math.sqrt(a*a+b*b-2*a*b*Math.cos(gamma));
